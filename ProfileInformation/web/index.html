                    OOP, or object-oriented programming, is a programming concept that involves objects.<br>
                    Objects are like entities that have special characteristics and unique actions. They <br>
                    are called attributes and methods using jargon terms. The concept is to create something<br>
                    that does a specific job using objects, and combining them modularly in order to achieve<br>
                    a greater task.
